//in order to write 'hello world' in Java, you need to create a class, call main method and inside there you need to use println() method
//what about in java
//in js you can use double quote("") or single quote('') as well.
//to run, you can use cntrl+shift+B as a shortcut
console.log('Hello World');

var quantity;
quantity = 5;
console.log(quantity);

var i = 100;
i = 10;
console.log(i);

//TYPESCRIPT
//it is not different programming language than js -- it is like superset of js -- after the typescript it has capable of write variables as java (typebase)

//ECMASCRİPT 2015 -- EC15
//ECMASCRİPT 2016 -- EC16 -- there are huge changes -- create class structure -- inheritance -- new variable declarations which is let and cons
//For JAVA side, Being know Java 8 is more important because it has made a lot of changes on to the previous version. Also it has made huge changes.
//Java 11 is getting little bit more popular but Java11 didnt come with the extreme changes.

var x = 5, y = 'String';
console.log(x + y);
//console.log(x * y);

//Variable naming rules: Same as JAVA
//var 4x = 10;
//console.log(4x); -- throws exception

//Primitive Data Types
//numbers : 123,120.50
//String: 'apple'
//Boolean: true,false
//Undefined: varible does not have a value yet
//Null

var a;
console.log(a);
console.log(typeof x); //typeof is a keyword that is show us datatype of variable

//prompt operator
var name = prompt('Enter your name');
console.log(name); // Same function is handled by Scanner class in JAVA. It lets you to give information from keyboard/console.
